# Introduction to Modules

Given the vast size of the Wordpress ecosystem, modules are our way of allowing some common plugins to integrate with your Inertia Wordpress adapter.

We're starting small with a few common plugins, but depending on support for the project, we'll carry on adding new modules and perhaps expanding the scope of current ones.

At their core, modules are classes that retrieve data from a plugin and then share that data with the frontend.

So for example, our module for [The SEO Framework](https://theseoframework.com/) grabs all of the meta tags generated by the plugin and then shares them with the frontend.

If you need to integrate a plugin we haven't covered, creating new modules is super easy, barely an inconvenience. See [Custom Modules](/modules/custom-modules) for more information.
