# Production

Once you're happy with your theme, or if you want others to be able to see your work, you'll need to create a production build of your frontend files.

```sh
npm run build
```

This script will do two things:

1. Create a standard production build of your theme
2. Create an SSR (server-side rendering) build of your theme

While the SSR build is optional, it does provide some benefits as we'll explain in the next section.
