# Finishing Your Theme Setup

## Installing Dependencies

To allow you to use the package manager of your choice, we've left this last step for you to complete.

Using your terminal, navigate to your new theme folder and install its dependencies:

::: code-group

```sh [PNPM]
pnpm install
```

```sh [NPM]
npm install
```

```sh [Yarn]
yarn install
```

:::

If everything works, you should see something like this:

## Helpers Scripts

From your theme directory, running `npm run` will show you the available helper scripts we've made for you:
