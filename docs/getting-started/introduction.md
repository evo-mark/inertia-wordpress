# Introduction

## Overview

Inertia is a modern approach to bringing fully client-side rendered single-page applications (SPA) to classic server-driven web apps.

Eschewing the complexity of setting up routing and hydrating data that a standard SPA brings, Inertia lets you use the standard routing and controllers that your server provides.

## Wordpress Adapter

While there have been a few attempts in the past, an Inertia adapter for Wordpress never allowed "The Modern Monolith" to reach its full potential.

At evoMark, we wanted to bring the community the full power of Inertia v2 and server-side rendering alongside brand new features that are uniquely necessary for the Wordpress ecosystem.

So here we are.

::: warning
This adapter is in active development and should be used with caution. There may be breaking changes between minor versions

## Support Open-Source

This project is free and open-source and committed to never paywalling features or extracting them into a pro version.

However, we can't do this without your help. So if you're able, please donate using the links below:
