# Installing Inertia Wordpress

First, install Wordpress as you would normally.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.2+
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer/current) 20+
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)
- [WP-CLI](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/guides/installing/)
- [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/) (for server-side rendering)

## Downloading

For reasons we won't go into here, we decided to self-distribute (with GitHub) this plugin rather than via the wordpress.org repository. You can download it by clicking the link below. Updates will be available through your Wordpress plugins menu as usual.
